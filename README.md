# AR-3D-Object-Reconstruction
  Created an Android application using Unity and Vuforia to augment a 3D model (Made in Regard3D and Blender) via a marker based AR Approach - complete with 3 finger gesture and pinch control for manipulation.  This project was done in November 2018 and was part of a semester project for my undergrad at IIIT Allahabad.
